# Updating the options.yaml

The options.yaml is used by doi2rdm from the irdmtools repository to map various metadata.
This includes publisher and journal titles. Publishers are first mapped via ISSN and there
is no match then the DOI prefix is checked for mapping. If a match is found it will 
update the imported metadata for the publisher to match the mapping in options.yaml
(see publisher_issn attribute values).  The Journal title is also checked against the ISSN
but NOT the DOI prefix. The mapping can be found in the journal_issn attribute.

The publisher and journal information is harvested from a CSV file currently (May 2024)
curated by George Porter (this will change after June). There is a tool in irdmtools, a
python script named update_publishers_options.py that can update the options.yaml based
on the current contents of the spreadsheet. This will not delete the existing options
content only add or replace the matching ISSN/DOI Prefixes.  The tool writes to
standard output. This is what I do to update options.yaml from a CSV file called
CaltechAUTHORS_publisher_groups.csv.

~~~shell
./update_publisher_options.py options.yaml CaltechAUTHORS_publisher_groups.csv \
    >new_options.yaml
~~~

I then look new_options.yaml over, might not hurst to test against known DOI and arXiv
identifiers. When I think new_options.yaml is correct then I move the file to 
options.yaml in the irdm_harvester repository and update the Git repo.

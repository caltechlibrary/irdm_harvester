## Introduction

Currently harvesting:

    - CrossRef by ROR
    - ORCID
    - CrossRef DOIs

The harvests are typically run through [GitHub actions](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/irdm_harvester/actions) 
but could also be run on the command line.

## Installation

You need to have a CaltechAUTHORS token available in the environment variable 
`RDMTOK`

Run as a GitHub action or on the comand line

```bash
python harvest.py
```

For command line use you need the latest version of `irdmtools` installed:

`curl https://caltechlibrary.github.io/irdmtools/installer.sh | sh`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Known issues and limitations

While this approach should work for any InvenioRDM repository, it has only been tested on 
CaltechAUTHORS. If you're interested in using this with a different repository reach out as we
would be happy to make it a bit more flexible.

Publishers use a wide variety of urls for licenses. We are currently adding
variants to the license.csv file, which is a custom file that connects urls to
the InvenioRDM license names. It is almost certainly incomplete.

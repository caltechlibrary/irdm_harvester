# InvenioRDM Harvester

This is a harvester that can automatically collect and submit works to an
InvenioRDM repository. It currently works with the CaltechAUTHORS repository and looks at CrossRef and ORCID.

## Introduction

Currently harvesting:

    - CrossRef by ROR
    - ORCID
    - CrossRef DOIs

## Usage

The harvests are typically run through [GitHub actions](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/irdm_harvester/actions) 
but could also be run on the command line.

You need to have a CaltechAUTHORS token available in the environment variable 
`RDMTOK`. For a CrossRef ROR harvest type

```bash
python harvest.py crossref
```

You can harvest a specific DOI with

```bash
python harvest.py -doi 10.7717/peerj-cs.1023
```

For an ORCID harvest type:

```bash
python harvest.py orcid -orcid 0000-0001-9266-5146
```

For all harvests there is an `-actor` flag, which gets included in the message when the record is added to the queue.

## Installation

For command line use you need the latest version of `irdmtools` installed:

`curl https://caltechlibrary.github.io/irdmtools/installer.sh | sh`

Then install the python requirements with

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Known issues and limitations

While this approach should work for any InvenioRDM repository, it has only been tested on 
CaltechAUTHORS. If you're interested in using this with a different repository reach out as we
would be happy to make it a bit more flexible.

Publishers use a wide variety of urls for licenses. We are currently adding
variants to the license.csv file, which is a custom file that connects urls to
the InvenioRDM license names. It is almost certainly incomplete.
